# Food Truck App Project

## Description
This project was completed following week two in the Java Full stack bootcamp. The Food Truck App allows users to enter and rate a list of food trucks. 
They can enter up to 5 trucks that will be stored. The user will then be 
prompted with a menu to compare the trucks. They can choose between four options:
list of the foodtrucks, average rating, highest rating, and exit the program. 
Additionally, the program will keep a running list of trucks entered, and assign
truck ID number.

##Lessons Learned
- Keep an eye on how many curly braces you have. When creating loops, it is easy to loose track of which curly braces belong where. 
- How to correctly generate getters and setters without manually inputting. 
- Learned about the importance of order... having certain methods before others, or where to put print lines within methods, etc.
